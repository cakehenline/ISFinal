    Also, here is a list of things I love to do and interesting things about me!
</p>

    <ol>
        <li>My "nickname" Cake is short for my middle name Kekoa. 
            <ul>
                <li>Yes, I know it should be Kake and not Cake :)</li>
            
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>I love to play basketball, football and volleyball.</li>
        <li>I want to be an entrepreneur!
            <ul>
                <li>When I was a little kid, I would sell pokemon cards <br>
                on ebay. With the money I made, I would "re-invest" my <br>
                profits by buying more packs of cards and selling the <br>
                cool ones on Ebay and to friends.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>My favorite place to eat with my wife is Chicfila!</li>
        <li>I love to do things outside like hiking, swimming and stargazing!</li>
        
    </ol>
